**Proposal**

For my project, I'm caught between a personal blog and a museum-type website displaying my artwork and various other projects that I am proud of. I have never really had much of a platform to share my art, so I definitely want to incorporate it somewhow. If I were to go more of a museum route, I would have it set up like in the rough sketch below with interfaces for each of the different types of art/creation I am interested in. The landing page would have a self-portrait so users know who is running the site along with a short “About Me” section giving some background. I’m between having links to the other pages in a drop-down menu or having them listed across the top of the screen so users can see what is available without clicking an icon to see. Some pages I would highlight are my audio projects (the one form this class and one I made for a class last semester), my drawings and paintings (most of which are old, but I still want to share them), photos I’ve taken and like, some of my inspiration, and perhaps a blog page. This does seem like a big undertaking as I am unfamiliar with web design, so I might have to cut some out. Like everything else, this project will have a learning curve and I plan on adjusting accordingly. Another part of me wants to do some sort of blog so I can share more about who I am as a person. I think the best solution is to combine the two. Finally, I normally stick with a black and white or muted color scheme when it comes to designing things; I want to mix it up for this project and do something fun and colorful.

**Reflective Writing 3/23/23**

I am excited to have a space to share some photos I especially like. I am not too sure how to perfectly design a website that isn't just a gallery of photos. I think the best way to get around this issue is to include a detailed description of each photo, whether that is the history of the location, why I took the photo/the context of it, or why it is special to me. I have a lot of ideas that I'd like to incorporate, but I just do not think that is feasible considering my skill level and time constraints. 

Websites that are easy to get through have the navigation bar easily accessible. They are more difficult to navigate when they have a lot of obtrusive design or if the user cannot tell what objects are links. Personally, I prefer websites that have different interfaces for each new topic rather than one continuous page with jumps. I find them to be easier to navigate.
