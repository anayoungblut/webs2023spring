**Proposal**

Formy project, I'm caught between a personal blog and a museum-type website displaying my artwork and various other projects that I am proud of. I have never really had much of a platform to share my art, so I definitely want to incorporate it somewhow. If I were to go more of a museum route, I would have it set up like in the rough sketch below with interfaces for each of the different types of art/creation I am interested in. The landing page would have a self-portrait so users know who is running the site along with a short “About Me” section giving some background. I’m between having links to the other pages in a drop-down menu or having them listed across the top of the screen so users can see what is available without clicking an icon to see. Some pages I would highlight are my audio projects (the one form this class and one I made for a class last semester), my drawings and paintings (most of which are old, but I still want to share them), photos I’ve taken and like, some of my inspiration, and perhaps a blog page. This does seem like a big undertaking as I am unfamiliar with web design, so I might have to cut some out. Like everything else, this project will have a learning curve and I plan on adjusting accordingly. Another part of me wants to do some sort of blog so I can share more about who I am as a person. I think the best solution is to combine the two.
