        <h1 class='title'>Avon, North Carolina</h1>
            <h2 class='description'>Avon, North Carolina is one of my favorite places
                on Earth. My family has been vacationing here every summer for almost 30
            years; my sisters, cousins, and I count down the days until we go back.</h2>

                      The sunset reflects off the clouds, turning them shades of pastel

                    <p class ='item-p'>This is a free bookshelf outside of a ceramic shop. There is 
                      something so beautiful about the contrast between the bright teal shelf, neutral siding,
                      and colorful books.

                    <p class ='item-p'> The Sound Side of the island is protected from the 
                      harsh waves of the Atlantic, making it much calmer. Sunsets are more vivid on the 
                      Sound Side because it faces West. This picture perfectly encapsulates
                      the feeling of tranquility that the Sound instills in its' visitors. </p>

                    coffee and pastry shop less than a quarter mile from the beach. My mom, sisters, aunt, and cousin
                  walk here once or twice during our week-long stay. </p>

                    <p class ='item-p'> This is the welcome sign when visitors walk onto the 
                      <a href='https://www.nps.gov/places/000/avon-fishing-pier.htm'>Avon Pier</a>. People can often be
                      seen fishing on top of it or surfing below it. The pier has suffered some 
                      damage in recent years as hurricanes have ravaged Hatteras Island, though 
                      it is always rebuilt and restored.
