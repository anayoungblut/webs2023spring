                <p class='item-p'>This is the <a href='https://www.tour.pitt.edu/tour/cathedral-learning'>Cathedral of Learning</a>, colloquially known as "Cathy"
                  among Pitt students. It is the tallest academic building 
                  in the Western Hemisphere and houses classrooms, offices, libraries, 
                  digital and computer labs, and a small food court. This building is also 
                  unique because it houses several Nationality Classrooms throughout the first
                  three floors; these rooms were designed in the styles of various ethnic groups
                  in Pittsburgh.

                <p class ='item-p'>This building is my favorite on campus. I love the way it is illuminated
                  from below, especially at dusk. It took me a while to figure out what this 
                  building is because it is not clearly marked on the outside. After some research,
                  I learned this building is the Pittsburgh Athletic Association. It is
                  not affiliated with the University, though it sits between a number of 
                  Pitt buildings, including Cathy and the William Pitt Union. Beyond the name of 
                  the building, all I am able to learn from the Internet is that the PAA
                  is a private social and athletic club.

              <p class ='item-p'>This photo is from the middle of <a href='http://exhibit.library.pitt.edu/oakland-a-look-back/'>South Oakland</a></a>, referred to by student
                residents as "South O." Oakland has been a historically residential area, 
                though it has seen a stark shift in the demographic of residents shift
                from permanent families to student renters.

                cylindrical Towers dorm buildings in background.' src='pitt-images/quad.JPG'/>
                <p class ='item-p'> This is the view of the Quad from the seventh floor of the <a href='https://www.studentaffairs.pitt.edu/studentunions/'>William Pitt
                  Union</a> (WPU). The WPU houses student affairs services, offices, student
                  workspaces, and a small food court in the basement. I often do schoolwork
                  in one of my secret study spots in the Union. Almost all of Pitt's dorms 
                  are located in the Quad, including Towers A, B, and C, which are known
                  for their unique cylindrical shape. Since Pitt is an urban campus, the Quad is 
                  entirely concrete; yet, the layout of the buildings insulate its' interios from the 
                  city noise just outside.

                  from the outside is shown in the photo above. Centered above the WPU food court, 
                  this window ceiling floods sunlight into the building.
