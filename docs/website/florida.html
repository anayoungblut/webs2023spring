                <p class ='item-p'> I took this picture the day after my 21st birthday.
                  The black birds contrasting against the bright blue sky and white clouds
                  with dark palm fronds in the corners creates a striking visual. There is some
                  disorder in the V-formation of the birds; they were in the proces
                  of switching the leader when I took this picture.

                <p class ='item-p'> This picture is of a cute food and drink stand. My grandma and I
                  visited a scenic lookout this day; this stand was at the location and we
                  went here for lunch. The owner was working the register and was being a stickler
                  for carding anyone who ordered alcohol. I had turned 21 the day before,
                  and joked with him that I was tempted to order a beer just for the fun 
                  of getting carded.

                <p class ='item-p'> This picture is of <a href='https://www.venicegov.com/visiting/south-jetty'>Jetties </a> in Venice, FL. 
                  Fishers frequent the Jetties in hopes of catching something good while 
                  tourists visit the rocky path to dolphins and other marine life. The day I took this picture,
                  <a href='https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/redtide.html'>Red Tide</a> was lingering in the air, making it difficult to breathe.

                golden hour light.' src='fl-images/shells.jpg'/>
                <p class ='item-p'> These are beach shells on Manasota Key. Most are broken or worn from 
                  being tumbled in the Gulf of Mexico and eventually washing up on shore, but their differences
                  make them beautiful. This photo was taken at sunset, so these shells 
                  are illuminated by the golden glow of a slowly sinking sun.
